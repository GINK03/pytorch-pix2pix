How to bulid Takao Fonts
------------------------
To build Takao Fonts, TTX/FontTools(https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/)
is required. On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install it by:

    $ sudo apt-get install fonttools

Steps to build on generic Linux systems:

  1. Get Takao Fonts source

         $ bzr branch lp:takao-fonts

     or

     Download takao-fonts-additions_*.tar.xz from
     https://launchpad.net/takao-fonts/+download
     and extract it.

  2. Build

         $ cd takao-fonts/
         $ make

You will get font files under "release" directory.


About ttx files
---------------
The "*.ttx" files in this archive are generated by the build process.
They fall under the files "any additional file created by the font 
developing program in the course of creating the Derived Program that 
can be used for further modification of the Derived Program" described 
in Article 3 Paragraph 1 (1)(b).
Because generated using IPA and IPAex Fonts, these are under IPA Font 
License Agreement 1.0.

After build run, "ttx/*.diff" are also generated. You can review it
to see what was actually changed from base fonts.
